The purpose of comments in HTML is to provide a way to add some explanation or informational text to our code without having that content getting rendered on the webpage.
When we write a comment ,for eg like this  <!-- demo comment -->, the content inside the comment tags will not be displayed in the rendered webpage.
This comment can be of help for developers, designers, or anyone else who reads the HTML source code to understand or wants to find some context about the code.
So basically ,comments can be used for explanation or documentation purpose ,(as the content does not get rendered on the webpage), and provide context to other people/Team members who are working with the code

For eg !-- Hello world -->
