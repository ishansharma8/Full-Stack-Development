The DOCTYPE Declaration tells web browsers what version of HTML is being used in a webpage.
Using the right DOCTYPE helps prevent issues and errors when building webpages.

for eg -
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Here the <!DOCTYPE html> indicates that the web page is using HTML5( which is the latest version of HTML).
Basicall ,The declaration wants to make sure that browsers interpret the document as HTML5.
